                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Taipei 101 is Taiwan’s most recognizable skyscraper and a symbol of modern Taipei. 
                    Standing 508 meters tall with 101 floors above ground, it was officially the world’s 
                    tallest building from 2004 to 2010. Today, it remains a major financial center, a 
                    popular tourist attraction, and a key part of the city skyline.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-10">
                    Inside the tower, you’ll find high-speed elevators, indoor and outdoor observatory decks, 
                    a multi-level shopping mall, and a wide range of restaurants and cafés. The building is also 
                    known for its green design and was one of the first supertall skyscrapers to receive 
                    LEED Platinum certification for energy efficiency.

                    <h3>Design and Engineering</h3>

                    <p>
                        Designed by architect C.Y. Lee, Taipei 101 combines modern engineering with 
                        traditional Asian symbolism. The stacked “bamboo” form represents growth and resilience, 
                        while many details—such as the repeated use of the number eight—reflect auspicious elements 
                        in Chinese culture.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-10">
                        Because Taiwan is prone to earthquakes and typhoons, Taipei 101 was built with advanced 
                        structural systems to handle strong winds and seismic activity. The most famous feature is 
                        the giant tuned mass damper: a 660-ton steel sphere suspended between the 87th and 92nd floors. 
                        It swings slightly to counteract building movement, making high floors more comfortable during 
                        storms.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-10">
                        Beyond its architectural significance, Taipei 101 has become a venue for major events, 
                        including the world-famous New Year’s Eve fireworks show, international races up its 
                        stairwells, and numerous cultural and commercial activities throughout the year.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            The Taipei 101 Observatory offers panoramic views of Taipei and the surrounding mountains 
                            from the upper floors of the tower. The indoor observatory is fully enclosed and air-conditioned, 
                            with large floor-to-ceiling windows and multilingual audio guides that explain landmarks across the city.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-10">
                            On good-weather days, the outdoor observatory (when open) lets you step onto a terrace and feel the 
                            height more directly. Sunset and early evening are especially popular times, as you can watch the city 
                            transition from day to night and see the lights of Xinyi District come alive.

                        <h3>Tuned Mass Damper</h3>
                        <p>
                            One of Taipei 101’s most unique features is its giant tuned mass damper: a massive 
                            golden sphere weighing around 660 tons, suspended by steel cables inside the tower. 
                            When strong winds or earthquakes cause the building to sway, the damper moves in the 
                            opposite direction, reducing the motion and keeping the ride more comfortable.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-10">
                            The damper is visible from the observatory, and information panels explain how it works 
                            in simple terms. For many visitors, seeing this huge ball gently oscillate is just as 
                            memorable as the city views outside.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the base of the tower, Taipei 101 Mall offers a mix of luxury brands, lifestyle shops, 
                            and specialty stores. Even if you don’t go up to the observatory, the mall area is worth a visit 
                            for window shopping and people-watching in the heart of Xinyi District.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-10">
                            The building and its surroundings also have plenty of dining options—from food courts and casual 
                            restaurants to upscale venues with views. It’s easy to combine a visit to Taipei 101 with nearby malls 
                            and pedestrian areas, making this one of the best spots in Taipei for an evening stroll.

                <h3>How to Make the Most of Your Visit</h3>
                <p>
                    For the best experience, consider timing your visit so you can see both daylight and night views—arriving 
                    about an hour before sunset works well. On weekends and holidays, the observatory can get crowded, so 
                    booking tickets in advance or visiting on a weekday usually means shorter lines.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-10">
                    Check the weather forecast before you go: low clouds, heavy rain, or poor air quality can significantly 
                    reduce visibility. If the view is completely blocked, it may be better to reschedule and simply enjoy the 
                    mall, restaurants, and surrounding Xinyi shopping district instead.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-10">
                    Elevators can be busy during peak times; follow staff instructions and be prepared for a short wait. 
                    If you’re planning a full day in the area, you can combine Taipei 101 with <a href="elephant_mountain.html" class="inline-link">Elephant Mountain</a> 
                    for great hiking views, or simply explore the nearby malls and plazas on foot.
