                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Yangmingshan National Park, located just north of central Taipei, is one of Taiwan’s most 
                    beloved natural escapes. Known for its rolling grasslands, volcanic peaks, hot springs, and 
                    ever-changing seasonal scenery, it offers a refreshing contrast to the city’s busy streets.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    Sitting atop the Tatun Volcano Group, the park features steaming fumaroles, sulfur vents, 
                    and dramatic mountain views, alongside tranquil hiking trails, flower fields, and quiet 
                    mountain villages. It’s one of the easiest places to experience Taiwan’s wild side in a 
                    single day trip from Taipei.
                </p>

                    <h3>Landscape & Background</h3>

                    <p>
                        Historically known as Grass Mountain due to its windswept grassy slopes, Yangmingshan was 
                        renamed in the mid-20th century in honor of the Ming dynasty philosopher Wang Yangming. 
                        The area’s geology is shaped by the Tatun Volcano Group, a still-active volcanic system 
                        that gives rise to fumaroles, hot springs, and sulfur vents scattered throughout the park.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                        Designated as a national park in 1985, Yangmingshan protects a rich mix of subtropical and 
                        temperate ecosystems. Its terrain ranges from forested valleys to open grasslands and 
                        steep volcanic peaks. The park is also an important ecological research area, home to 
                        diverse bird species, butterflies, and unique highland flora.

                            Xiaoyoukeng, located in Yangmingshan National Park, is one of Taiwan’s most striking 
                            volcanic sites. Situated on the western slope of Mt. Qixing, it is famous for its dramatic 
                            geothermal landscape created by the Tatun Volcano Group. The area features active fumaroles, 
                            sulfur vents, steaming cliffs, and deposits of bright yellow sulfur crystals, giving visitors 
                            a rare, close-up look at ongoing volcanic activity.

                            Qingtiangang Grassland, located in Yangmingshan National Park, is a vast lava terrace 
                            formed by ancient volcanic activity. The area is known for its wide-open meadows, gently 
                            rolling hills, and peaceful atmosphere that feels far removed from the city. One of its 
                            most charming features is the presence of free-grazing cattle, which have become a well-loved 
                            symbol of the landscape.

                            Mt. Qixing, located in Yangmingshan National Park, is the highest peak in Taipei at 1,120 
                            meters. Formed by the Tatun Volcano Group, the mountain is known for its striking volcanic 
                            landscape, including fumaroles, sulfur vents, and rich geothermal activity. Well-marked hiking 
                            trails lead visitors through lush forests, grassy ridges, and areas of steaming volcanic terrain.

                <h3>How to Make the Most of Your Visit</h3>
                <p>
                    Weather in Yangmingshan can be cooler and windier than in downtown Taipei, especially in winter 
                    and at higher elevations. Bring a light jacket, comfortable walking shoes, and rain gear if the 
                    forecast is unstable. Fog is common, so don’t be surprised if the scenery changes dramatically 
                    within minutes.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    On weekends and during flower seasons, popular areas like Zhuzihu and Xiaoyoukeng can get crowded. 
                    Visiting on weekday mornings usually offers a more relaxed experience. If you plan to hike, check 
                    route times in advance and keep an eye on the daylight, especially in winter when sunset comes early.
                </p>
