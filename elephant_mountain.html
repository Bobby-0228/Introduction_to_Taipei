                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Elephant Mountain, known locally as <strong>Xiangshan</strong>, is one of the most popular
                    urban hiking trails in Taipei. Just a short walk from the city streets, this hill offers
                    spectacular views over Taipei 101, the Xinyi skyline, and the surrounding mountains.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-10">
                    The hike itself is relatively short but quite steep, consisting mostly of stone stairs.
                    Most visitors reach the main viewing platforms in about 15–25 minutes, making it an easy
                    add-on to a day spent around Taipei 101 or the Xinyi District.
                </p>

                    <h3>The Trail and Viewpoints</h3>

                    <p>
                        The most common starting point is near Xiangshan MRT Station (Red Line). From Exit 2,
                        it takes about 10 minutes to reach the trailhead, where a series of stone steps leads
                        you up through forested slopes and pavilions.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-10">
                        Along the way, several viewing decks and rest areas offer chances to catch your breath
                        and enjoy the scenery. The most famous spots are the viewing platforms and large boulders
                        near the main lookout, where many of the iconic Taipei 101 photos are taken.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-10">
                        From Elephant Mountain, more experienced hikers can continue on to neighboring peaks
                        such as Tiger Mountain, Leopard Mountain, and Lion Mountain as part of the Four Beasts
                        trail system, but most casual visitors are happy to stop at the main viewpoints.

                        <p>
                            The standard Elephant Mountain trail is short but steep, consisting largely of
                            well-maintained stone steps. Most people with average fitness can reach the main
                            viewpoints in 15–25 minutes, but you should still expect to break a sweat.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-10">
                            There are railings along much of the path, and benches or pavilions where you can
                            stop to rest. The trail is family-friendly, though small children and people with
                            knee issues may find the stairs challenging.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Several viewing platforms along the trail offer different angles of Taipei 101
                            and the city. The most famous spots are near the top, where raised decks and
                            large rocks create iconic vantage points.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-10">
                            These areas can get crowded at sunset and on weekends, especially with tripods
                            and photographers setting up for long-exposure shots of the city lights. If you
                            want a good photo spot, arrive early and be prepared to share space with others.

                        <p>
                            The most popular time to visit Elephant Mountain is around sunset, when you can
                            see the city gradually light up as the sky changes color. On clear days, you get
                            both daylight and night views in a single visit.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-10">
                            Evening hikes are very common; the trail is equipped with lights, and you’ll
                            rarely be alone. Still, good shoes and a small flashlight or phone light are
                            helpful, especially for the steps on the way down.

                <h3>How to Make the Most of Your Visit</h3>
                <p>
                    Wear comfortable shoes and bring water, especially in the warmer months—Taipei can be
                    hot and humid, and the stairs feel much longer when you are dehydrated. A small towel
                    or tissues are handy if you tend to sweat easily.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-10">
                    Try to plan around the weather: clear days offer the best visibility, while heavy rain
                    can make the steps slippery and views disappointing. On summer afternoons, consider
                    starting later in the day to avoid the strongest sun, and use sunblock or a hat.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-10">
                    Many visitors combine Elephant Mountain with a visit to
                    <a href="taipei101.html" class="inline-link">Taipei 101</a>, since both are located
                    in or near the Xinyi District. Hike for the view first, then head down for dinner or
                    shopping in the city below.
