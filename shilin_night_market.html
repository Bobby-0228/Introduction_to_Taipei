                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Shilin Night Market is one of the biggest and most famous night markets in Taiwan. 
                    Located in the Shilin District of Taipei, it is known for its lively atmosphere, 
                    endless street food, and maze-like alleys filled with vendors, shops, and game stalls.

                <h3>Historical Background</h3>
                <p>
                    The market traces its origins back to the early 1900s, beginning as the Shilin daytime market 
                    near Cicheng Temple. Night market activities began forming around 1913 and expanded 
                    throughout the surrounding streets. Today, Shilin has evolved into a major entertainment 
                    and culinary destination that attracts millions of visitors every year.

                            Shilin’s famous chicken cutlet comes in two irresistible styles:<br>
                            - The classic version is <strong>deep-fried</strong> to a golden, crispy finish.<br>
                            - Some stalls <strong>grill it over charcoal after frying</strong>, adding smoky aroma and caramelized edges.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-10">

                            • <strong>Fried</strong> — crispy outside, tender inside, served with pickled cabbage.<br>
                            • <strong>Stewed</strong> — simmered in a rich broth, softer and more pungent.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-10">
                            A must-try for adventurous eaters — the smell is strong, but the flavor wins many fans.

                <h3>How to Make the Most of Your Visit</h3>
                <p>
                    Shilin Night Market gets busy, especially on weekends and holidays. 
                    If you want to avoid the biggest crowds, aim to arrive in the early evening 
                    (around 5~6 pm) or later at night after 9:00 pm. Most food stalls stay open 
                    until around midnight.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-10">
                    Start from <strong>Jiantan Station Exit 1 (Not Shilin Station!)</strong>, follow the crowd toward the main entrance, 
                    and slowly work your way through side alleys. Try sharing dishes with friends so you can 
                    sample more stalls without getting full too quickly. Wear comfortable shoes—the alleys can 
                    be narrow, slightly uneven, and you might end up walking more than you expect.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-10">
                    Be prepared for strong smells (like stinky tofu), lots of sizzling grills, and game 
                    booths with claw machines and carnival-style games. If you prefer a more relaxed vibe, 
                    visit on a weekday night and avoid typhoon days or heavy rain when some outdoor stalls 
                    may close early.
                </p>
