                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The National Palace Museum (NPM) in Taipei is home to one of the world’s finest collections of
                    Chinese imperial art and cultural relics. With hundreds of thousands of artifacts spanning
                    over 8,000 years—from Neolithic pottery to masterpieces from the Qing dynasty—the museum
                    offers a deep and beautifully curated journey through Chinese history.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    Visitors can explore galleries dedicated to jade, bronzes, ceramics, calligraphy, painting,
                    rare books, and more, all housed in a building inspired by traditional Chinese palace
                    architecture.

                <h3>Historical Background</h3>
                <p>
                    The museum’s core collection originated from the imperial palaces in Beijing, especially the
                    Forbidden City. During the turbulent years of the early 20th century, these treasures were
                    relocated multiple times for safekeeping. Eventually, a significant portion was transferred
                    to Taiwan, and the National Palace Museum in Taipei officially opened in 1965.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    Today, the museum stands as a major cultural landmark in East Asia, combining traditional
                    aesthetics with modern exhibition design and conservation technology.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            The Jadeite Cabbage is one of the most beloved pieces in the National Palace Museum.
                            It uses the natural green and white colors of the jade to create realistic cabbage
                            leaves and stalks, with a locust and katydid hidden among the leaves.

                            💡 Fun fact: The cabbage symbolizes purity and fertility, and is often interpreted
                            as a blessing for many descendants.

                        <p>
                            The Mao Gong Ding is a large bronze ritual tripod from the Western Zhou dynasty.
                            It is renowned for having the longest inscription found on any ancient Chinese bronze,
                            recording royal commands and political events of the time.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.95rem; opacity: 0.8;">
                            💡 Fun fact: The inscription on Mao Gong Ding is a key source for understanding
                            early Zhou political history and ritual culture.

                        <p>
                            The Meat-shaped Stone is a piece of banded jasper carved and colored to resemble a
                            piece of braised pork belly. Its layers of “fat” and “lean meat” follow the natural
                            pattern of the stone, making it incredibly realistic.
                        </p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.95rem; opacity: 0.8;">
                            💡 Fun fact: It is one of the most photographed objects in the museum—despite looking
                            delicious, it is of course completely inedible.

                <p>
                    The collection is huge, and it’s impossible to see everything in one go. For a first-time visit,
                    focus on a few key areas such as jade, bronzes, and the “Three Treasures” section. The museum
                    also offers audio guides and guided tours in multiple languages.

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    For a more relaxed experience, visit on weekday mornings or later in the afternoon. You can also
                    combine your trip with the nearby Zhishan Garden or head to Shilin Night Market in the evening
                    for food and street life.
